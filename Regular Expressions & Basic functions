Special Sequence	Meaning	Example
\d	Matches any digit character (0-9)	"123" matches "\d\d\d"
\D	Matches any non-digit character	"hello" matches "\D\D\D\D\D"
\w	Matches any word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _)	"hello_world" matches "\w\w\w\w\w\w\w\w\w\w\w"
\W	Matches any non-word character	"@#$%" matches "\W\W\W\W"
\s	Matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline, etc.)	"hello world" matches "\w\w\w\w\w\s\w\w\w\w\w"
\S	Matches any non-whitespace character	"hello_world" matches "\S\S\S\S\S\S\S\S\S\S\S"
\b	Matches the boundary between a word character and a non-word character	"cat" matches "\bcat\b" in "The cat sat on the mat"
\B	Matches any position that is not a word boundary	"cat" matches "\Bcat\B" in "category" but not in "The cat sat on the mat"
